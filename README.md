This research involves identification of clouds, and prediction of their phase (liquid or ice) and cloud optical thickness (COT), in satellite imagery.
 
The primary satellite instrument of interest is the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) to be launched on the forthcoming NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite in early 2024. However, the project also includes results for the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) and Advance Baseline Imager (ABI) instruments that are the US' current operational polar-orbiting and geostationary imagers.
